          <img src="../images/dragonborn.jpg" class="article-img" alt="Photo of a Dragonborn miniature">
          <p>This dragonborn was painted with Vallejo's Old Gold. The cloak is Army Painter's Glitter Green.</p>
          <p>The flaming sword was printed in transparent plastic, which gave me an opportunity to do something a little different. Instead of a solid base coat, I was able to keep its translucent property by using a thinner contrast paint, in this case Citadel's Iyanden Yellow.</p>
          <p>Some of the detail in this miniature's scales and armor is brought out using Army Painter's Quickshade varnish (strong tone). Quickshade varnishes are really good for bringing out details in textured minis; however, it does also result in a shiny surface. This works for a dragonborn, but if you don't care for it, you can apply a matte finish.

          <img src="../images/kobold.jpg" class="article-img" alt="Photo of a Kobold Miniature">
          <p>This is the miniature I painted for my Kobold artificer, Kibo. Kibo's primary color is Army Painter's Evil Chrome, with Iraqi Sand for the canvas pieces.</p>
          <p>Kibo's pistol and other metal pieces use a specialty paint, Stuart Semple's mirror paint, which gives a very bright finish to any metallic pieces.</p>

          <img src="../images/mindflayer.jpg" class="article-img" alt="Photo of a Kobold Miniature">
          <p>The Mindflayer's otherworldly colors come from a set of color-shifting paints, Stuart Semple's Lovetone. The robe is painted with "Pleasurable Anger" while the alien flesh comes from "Intense Apathy". Additional detail comes from Semple's Gold paint.</p>

          <img src="../images/owlbear.jpg" class="article-img" alt="Photo of a Kobold Miniature">
          <p>This little guy is a baby owlbear, painted with Vallejo's Burnt Umber and Army Painter's Ash Grey.</p>
          <p>Dry-brushing brings to life his downy feathers and fur.</p>

          <p>Painting miniatures is a really great hobby for anyone who loves tabletop games, wargames or just for your own collection. If you're interested, check out this video from the Geek & Sundry Painters Guild, featuring Will Friedle and Matt Mercer.</p>
